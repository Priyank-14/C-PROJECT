# Matrix Calculator in C

## 📘 About the Project
This project is a **menu-driven Matrix Calculator implemented in C**.  
It was created during my **B.Tech 1st Year – 1st Semester** to **understand and implement the maximum number of C programming concepts learned throughout the semester**.

The project focuses on applying theoretical knowledge into a practical console-based application using **functions, arrays, loops, and conditional statements**.
